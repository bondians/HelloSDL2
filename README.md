Hello SDL2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bondians/HelloSDL2.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bondians/HelloSDL2)
===========

Currently should build on Mac OS or Linux.
On Mac OS, tries first to use pkg-config to find SDL2, otherwise falls back to asking the compiler to find it as a framework (e.g. in /Library/Frameworks).
